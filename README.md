# Web-API-.NET

##About: 

Simple **CRUD Web API** created in the **.NET core framework**. Allows for the creation and modification of To-do items, as well as an additional creation of financial items.
For the most part I used a microsoft tutorial to help me get started. Then I added my own spin onto it by practicing creating a financial helper section that allows the user
to create a table full of financial items that either add or subtract from their total expenses. 

##Whay I Learned: 

Throughout the process I learned the **foundation of an API**. I created **Models** for different items, a **Database Context** for each item, as well as a **controller** to handle** HTTP requests**.
On the front end, I learned basic **HTML** and **CSS** skills to display information and allow the user to create/update/delete items. As well as incorporating **JavaScript** functions into each individual page. In addition, I learned about what **Data Transfer Objects** (DTOs) are and how they assist in hiding private information from the users, but not from priviledged users.
